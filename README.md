This was written to help in the large number prime programs. Helped me figure out a few things.

As this is a simple array approach it does not accept negative numbers as input but can generate negative numbers in output from substraction calculations.

Instructions for use are in the code (note: the carriage returns are not necessary). The program will take input such as:

12345678912345678901234567890*123456789012345678901234567890=<return> (no spaces).

or p for plus(+), m for minus(-), x for times(asterix *) and e for equals(=).


Fully aware my arrays start at 1. This space was reserved for possible future use with a symbol indicating a negative number.
Got stuck in that habit for a while.

Up to 1000 digits but this can be made larger. It loops, escape by closing console or cntrl-c.
